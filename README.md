# The Influence of Robot Role Priority on Blame and Trust Attribution

[cite_start]This project investigates how a robot's designated social role—specifically its priority—influences human attribution of blame and trust during coordination failures. [cite: 1, 6]

> [cite_start]**DISCLAIMER: This is a "ready to run" demo study.** The results described below are **projected** based on comparable studies in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) literature rather than newly collected empirical data. [cite: 91, 92]

## 📋 Overview
[cite_start]As autonomous robots integrate into complex environments like hospitals, coordination failures are inevitable. [cite: 5, 15] [cite_start]This research explores how functional labels (e.g., "Medicine Delivery" vs. "Trash Disposal") serve as psychological frames that significantly alter how humans interpret and rate technical errors. [cite: 10, 25]

## 🔍 Research Hypotheses
* [cite_start]**H1: The Competence Cliff** – High-priority robots will experience a significantly larger decline in perceived competence following a failure compared to low-priority robots due to the violation of higher initial expectations. [cite: 50]
* [cite_start]**H2: Hierarchical Blame** – Participants will attribute more responsibility for coordination failures to low-priority robots, reflecting a social bias where lower-status agents are expected to yield. [cite: 51]
* [cite_start]**H3: Role Rationalization** – Qualitative justifications will cite "urgency" as a mitigating factor for high-priority robots, while low-priority robots are blamed due to a perceived lack of consequence. [cite: 52]

## 🛠 Methodology
[cite_start]The study utilizes a **between-subjects experimental design** ($N=128$) featuring 3D animated hospital scenarios. [cite: 55, 56, 60]



### Experimental Conditions
* [cite_start]**Condition 1 (Low Priority Failure):** Both robots meet in a corridor; the trash robot fails to yield, causing a failure. [cite: 70]
* [cite_start]**Condition 2 (High Priority Failure):** Both robots meet in a corridor; the medicine robot fails to yield, causing a failure. [cite: 71]

### Measurement Scales
* [cite_start]**MDMT:** Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust (Reliability and Ethical trust). [cite: 82]
* [cite_start]**ROSAS:** Robotic Social Attributes Scale (Competence, Warmth, and Discomfort). [cite: 83]
* [cite_start]**Blame Attribution:** Analysis of open-ended responsibility descriptions. [cite: 84]

## 📈 Theoretical Model: The Competence Cliff
The project applies **Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory** to HRI. [cite_start]High-priority roles establish a high baseline of reliability; when this is violated, the resulting drop in perceived competence is significantly steeper than that of a low-priority agent. [cite: 137, 139, 143]



## 🚀 Future Directions
* [cite_start]Transitioning from animated stimuli to physical robot interactions in controlled hospital mock-ups. [cite: 168]
* [cite_start]Expanding the participant pool beyond university students to include healthcare professionals. [cite: 168]
* [cite_start]Testing blame attribution between two high-priority robots (e.g., Security vs. Medicine). [cite: 156]
