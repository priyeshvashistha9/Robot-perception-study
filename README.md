# The Influence of Robot Role Priority on Blame and Trust Attribution

This repository contains the experimental framework and research design for investigating how a robot's designated social role—specifically its priority—influences human attribution of blame and trust during coordination failures.

## 📌 Overview
As autonomous robots integrate into complex environments like hospitals, coordination failures are inevitable. This study explores how functional labels (e.g., "Medicine Delivery" vs. "Trash Disposal") serve as psychological frames that alter how humans interpret technical errors.

## 🔍 Research Hypotheses
* **H1 (The Competence Cliff):** High-priority robots experience a significantly larger decline in perceived competence following a failure due to the violation of higher initial performance expectations.
* **H2 (Hierarchical Blame):** Participants attribute more responsibility for coordination failures to low-priority robots, reflecting a social bias where lower-status agents are expected to yield.
* **H3 (Role Rationalization):** Qualitative justifications for blame cite "urgency" as a mitigating factor for high-priority robots, while low-priority robots are blamed due to a perceived lack of consequence.

## 🛠 Methodology
The study utilizes a **between-subjects experimental design** ($N=128$) featuring 3D animated hospital scenarios.

### Experimental Conditions
* **Condition 1:** High-priority "Medicine Delivery" robot fails to yield.
* **Condition 2:** Low-priority "Trash Disposal" robot fails to yield.

### Measures
* **Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust (MDMT):** Evaluates reliability and ethical trust.
* **Robotic Social Attributes Scale (ROSAS):** Measures competence, warmth, and discomfort.
* **Blame Attribution:** Analysis of open-ended responsibility descriptions.

## 📈 Theoretical Model: The Competence Cliff
The project applies **Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory** to Human-Robot Interaction. High-priority roles establish a high baseline of reliability; when this is violated, the resulting drop in perceived competence is significantly steeper than that of a low-priority agent.

## 🚀 Future Directions
* Transitioning from animated stimuli to physical robot interactions in controlled hospital mock-ups.
* Expanding the participant pool to include healthcare professionals and domain experts.
* Testing blame attribution between two high-priority robots (e.g., Security vs. Medicine).
