# The Influence of Robot Role Priority on Blame and Trust Attribution

This project investigates how a robot's designated social role—specifically its priority—influences human attribution of blame and trust during coordination failures in multi-robot environments.

## 📋 Project Overview
As autonomous robots integrate into complex environments like hospitals, coordination failures are inevitable. This research explores how functional labels (e.g., "Medicine Delivery" vs. "Trash Disposal") serve as psychological frames that significantly alter how humans interpret and rate technical errors.

## 🔍 Research Hypotheses
* **H1: The Competence Cliff** – High-priority robots (Medicine Delivery) will experience a significantly larger decline in perceived competence following a failure compared to low-priority robots (Trash Disposal) due to the violation of higher initial performance expectations.
* **H2: Hierarchical Blame** – Participants will attribute more responsibility for coordination failures to low-priority robots, reflecting a social bias where lower-status agents are expected to yield.
* **H3: Role Rationalization** – Qualitative justifications will cite the "urgency" of the high-priority robot as a mitigating factor, while the low-priority robot will be blamed due to a perceived lack of consequence.

## 🛠 Methodology
The study utilizes a **between-subjects experimental design** ($N=128$) using 3D animated hospital scenarios.



### Experimental Conditions
* **Condition 1 (Low Priority Failure):** Both robots meet in a corridor; the trash robot fails to yield, causing a failure.
* **Condition 2 (High Priority Failure):** Both robots meet in a corridor; the medicine robot fails to yield, causing a failure.

### Measurement Scales
* **MDMT:** Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust (Reliability and Ethical trust).
* **ROSAS:** Robotic Social Attributes Scale (Competence, Warmth, and Discomfort).
* **Blame Attribution:** Analysis of open-ended responsibility descriptions.

## 📈 Theoretical Model: The Competence Cliff
The project applies **Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory** to HRI. High-priority roles establish a high baseline of reliability; when this is violated, the resulting drop in perceived competence is significantly steeper than that of a low-priority agent.



## 🚀 Future Directions
* **Empirical Collection:** Transitioning from the proposed design to live data collection with the target sample of 128 participants.
* **Physical Prototyping:** Replacing animated stimuli with physical robots in controlled hospital mock-ups or VR environments.
* **Expert Perspectives:** Expanding the participant pool to include healthcare professionals to see how domain expertise influences blame attribution.
