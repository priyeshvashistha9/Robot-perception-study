# The Influence of Robot Role Priority on Blame and Trust Attribution in Multi-Robot Coordination Failures

[cite_start]This project investigates how a robot's designated social role—specifically its priority—influences human attribution of blame and trust during coordination failures[cite: 1, 6]. [cite_start]Conducted at **Queen's University**, the study explores the psychological framing effect of functional labels in high-stakes environments like hospitals[cite: 4, 10].

## 📋 Project Overview
[cite_start]As autonomous robots enter complex environments, coordination failures are inevitable[cite: 5, 15]. [cite_start]This research bridges the gap in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) literature by moving from dyadic (1-on-1) interactions to multi-agent system failures[cite: 23, 25].

### Key Hypotheses
* [cite_start]**H1: The Competence Cliff** – High-priority robots (e.g., Medicine Delivery) face a steeper decline in perceived competence after failure due to violated high expectations[cite: 50].
* [cite_start]**H2: Hierarchical Blame** – Observers attribute more responsibility to low-priority robots (e.g., Trash Disposal), reflecting a social bias where lower-status agents are expected to yield[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]**H3: Role Rationalization** – Participants excuse high-priority robots due to their "urgency" while scapegoating low-priority robots[cite: 52].

## 🧪 Methodology
[cite_start]The study uses a **between-subjects experimental design** with 128 participants[cite: 55, 56].

### Experimental Stimuli
[cite_start]Participants viewed 3D animated videos of a navigation failure in a hospital hallway featuring two distinct robots[cite: 60, 65]:
1.  [cite_start]**Medicine Delivery Robot:** High-priority agent[cite: 62].
2.  [cite_start]**Trash Disposal Robot:** Low-priority agent[cite: 64].



### Measurement Scales
* [cite_start]**MDMT (Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust):** Assesses reliability and ethical trust[cite: 82].
* [cite_start]**ROSAS (Robotic Social Attributes Scale):** Measures perceived competence, warmth, and discomfort[cite: 83].
* [cite_start]**Qualitative Attribution:** Open-ended responses to identify blame patterns[cite: 84].

## 📉 Theoretical Model
[cite_start]The project is grounded in **Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory**, illustrating how role-based framing sets the "trust fall distance"[cite: 139, 144].

## 🚀 Future Work
* [cite_start]**Empirical Data Collection:** Transitioning from the proposed design to live data from the target sample[cite: 168].
* [cite_start]**Increased Fidelity:** Replacing animated stimuli with physical robots or VR environments to enhance ecological validity[cite: 168].
* [cite_start]**Diverse Demographics:** Expanding the participant pool to include healthcare professionals[cite: 168].
